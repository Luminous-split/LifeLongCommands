## C2 Server
- That is a hub/server that agents call back to.

## Listener
- Listener process that runs on C2 server or redirector listen for callbacks from compromised hosts over specific ports or protocols and maintain communication between two

## Agents
- Agent is a piece of code or mechanism generated by c2 framework to connect back to the listener running on the C2 server

## Implant
- Mechanism that provides interactive remote access to the target system

## Beacon/Beaconing
- This refers to when a compromised host with an active implant/agent calls-back to the C2 server for instructions.

## Interface
- Control mechanism providing operators with interactive access to the C2 server. (Empire Client)

## Payload
- Piece of code executed on target system in order to achieve a specific goal like establishing a reverse shell.

## Stager
- A stager is a small executable that is an initial payload. It is a relatively small piece of code that is executed to prepare for a much larger and more capable payload known as the stage payload

## Jitter
- Jitter allows you to add some variability to the sleep timer in order to make the communication/traffic look less sequential.
Some C2 Frameworks provide the ability to modify packets.

## Sleep Timer
- Sleep Timers are used to modify the rate at which an agent sends beacons to a C2 server. (Sleep timer of 10 seconds means that the agent will send a beacon out every 10 seconds)
