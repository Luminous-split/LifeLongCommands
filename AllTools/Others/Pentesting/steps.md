### Step	Description	Tools/Techniques
### 1. Pre-engagement	Define scope, obtain permission, and agree on rules of engagement.	Legal documents (RoE), communication with stakeholders.
### 2. Reconnaissance	Gather information about the target using passive and active methods.	theHarvester, Recon-ng, Amass, Nmap, Sublist3r, search engines, WHOIS, OSINT techniques.
### 3. Vulnerability Scanning	Identify vulnerabilities in target systems using automated and manual scanning.	Nessus, OpenVAS, Nikto, manual verification.
### 4. Exploitation	Exploit identified vulnerabilities to demonstrate potential risks.	Metasploit, Burp Suite, sqlmap, custom scripts, manual testing.
### 5. Post-exploitation	Validate exploits, analyze impact, and document findings for remediation.	ProxyChains, Cobalt Strike (for pivoting, if applicable), manual testing.
### 6. Reporting	Prepare a comprehensive report detailing findings, evidence, and remediation recommendations.	Reporting templates (e.g., OWASP), documentation tools like CherryTree.
### 7. Cleanup	Remove artifacts (e.g., test accounts, payloads) and restore disrupted services.	Manual cleanup, system checks.
