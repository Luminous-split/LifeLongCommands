## What is Social Engineering?
- In the context of penetration testing and red teaming, social engineering is a technique used to manipulate individuals or employees within an organization to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, systems, or facilities.
- It exploits human psychology, trust, and vulnerabilities to deceive targets into performing actions that compromise security, either through information disclosure or by performing specific actions that may seem innocuous at first glance.
- Social engineering attacks aim to bypass technical controls by targeting the weakest link in the security chain: the human element.
- The premise of social engineering is to exploit the human element, in other words, putting people or employees in situations where they will rely on their base instincts and most common forms of social interaction like:
• The desire to be helpful
• The tendency to trust people
• The desire for approval
• The fear of getting in trouble
• Avoiding conflict or arguments
