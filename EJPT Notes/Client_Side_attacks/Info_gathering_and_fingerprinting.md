## Client Fingerprinting
- Client fingerprinting is a technique used to gather information about a user's web browser and software stack in order to aid in the development of tailor made (client specific) payloads for initial access.
- In the context of client-side information gathering, client fingerprinting can be used to identify key information about the client-side software running on the target(s) system. For example, browser and browser version, OS and system architecture etc.
