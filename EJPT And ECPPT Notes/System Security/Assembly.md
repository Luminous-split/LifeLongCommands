### Assembly Language
• Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is closely related to the machine code instructions of a specific CPU architecture.
• It provides a symbolic representation of the machine instructions and allows programmers to write instructions using mnemonics and symbolic labels rather than binary code.
• Different CPU architectures have their own instruction sets and assembly languages.
• For example, x86 assembly language is used for Intel and AMD processors, while ARM assembly language is used for ARM-based processors.

### CPU Specific Assembly Languages
• Intel Assembly Language and ARM Assembly Language are two distinct assembly languages designed for different CPU architectures: x86 (Intel) and
ARM, respectively.
#### Intel Assembly Language (x86/x64)
• Intel Assembly Language is specific to Intel's x86 and x64 CPU architectures, which are widely used in personal computers, servers, and other computing devices.
#### ARM Assembly Language
• ARM Assembly Language is specific to the ARM architecture, which is widely used in mobile devices, embedded systems, and increasingly in other computing devices.

### Intel Assembly
Intel Architecture-specific assembly language is typically referred to simply as "Intel Assembly Language" or "x86 Assembly Language" for the 32-bit version, and "x86-64 Assembly Language" for the 64-bit version.
• These terms directly reflect the architecture of the Intel processors for which the assembly language is designed.
• Additionally, it may sometimes be referred to as IA-32 Assembly Language for the 32-bit version, where "IA" stands for "Intel Architecture." Similarly, the
64-bit version may be referred to as "IA-32e" or "Intel 64" assembly language.

#### IA-32
• In this course we will be using IA-32 Assembly on Linux.
• Why IA-32?
• A large number of processors/systems are still running lA-32.
• Learning and understanding IA-32 is the best place to start and provides a logical progression to IA-64.
